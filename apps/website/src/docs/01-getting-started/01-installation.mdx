# Installation

## System Requirements

Before you begin, make sure your system meets the following requirements:

- Node.js 20+
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), or Linux.
- A text editor or IDE.

## Creating a new project

The fastest way to get started is using the `create-xmcp-app` command, which will scaffold a new project with all the necessary files and configuration:

```bash filename="terminal"
npm create xmcp-app@latest
```

On installation, the command will prompt you to configure your project. You will be asked to:

- Set a directory name for your project (or the current one)
- Select a package manager (npm, pnpm, or yarn)
- Choose transports (HTTP, STDIO, or both)
- Configure Vercel deployment (optional)

And to review the selection. For automated setup without prompts, use the `--yes` flag with additional options like `--use-pnpm` or `--vercel`.

The recommended setup for building and deploying is as follows:

```bash filename="terminal"
  - Package Manager: pnpm
  - Transports: http
  - Vercel deploy: Yes
```

## Project Structure

After installation, you will notice the main structure of your project looks like this:

```bash
my-mcp-app/
├── src/
│   ├── tools/
│   ├── index.ts
│   └── xmcp.config.ts
├── package.json
├── tsconfig.json
```

// TO DO
// Add a table/reference to all the files available and their purpose.
// they could link to API reference for more details on customization etc

## Run the development server

1. Open a terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
3. You should see output indicating that the server is running on HTTP, if this was your initial transport configuration.
4. The default project includes an example "add" tool that you can test by making a POST request to the `/mcp` endpoint.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the `@modelcontextprotocol/inspector` package to test your MCP server.
> This proxies to your local/remote server. If running locally you can take advantage of the hot reloading feature to automatically restart the server and test your changes.

## Next steps

You have got everything set up and ready to go. Continue to [Creating Your First Tool](./first-tool) to start building.
