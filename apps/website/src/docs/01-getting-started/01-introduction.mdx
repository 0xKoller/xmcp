# Introduction to xmcp

**xmcp** is a TypeScript framework that simplifies building and deploying applications using the Model Context Protocol (MCP). The framework handles complex infrastructure tasks like transport management, authentication, and building, allowing you to focus on creating powerful tools and resources that AI models can use.

## What is the Model Context Protocol?

The Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI models to securely access external data and tools. It enables AI assistants to connect to databases, APIs, and file systems, execute tools safely in controlled environments, and maintain context across conversations while handling authentication and resource management.

## Why xmcp?

xmcp provides a developer-friendly approach to building MCP applications with hot reloading for instant feedback, file system routing that automatically discovers tools from your `src/tools/` directory, and TypeScript-first development with full type safety. The framework works out of the box with sensible defaults while offering rich tooling through a built-in CLI for development, building, and deployment.

The framework supports multiple transport mechanisms including HTTP for web services and STDIO for local execution, making it platform agnostic so you can deploy anywhere that runs Node.js. Built-in Vercel support enables serverless deployment, while production-optimized builds use webpack bundling for efficiency.

Security is handled through authentication middleware supporting API keys, JWT, and OAuth 2.0, along with CORS configuration, automatic request validation, and rate limiting protection.

## Core Concepts

**Tools** are the building blocks of your MCP application. Each tool defines a specific function with a clear input/output schema, includes metadata for documentation, and can be synchronous or asynchronous.

**Transports** handle communication between your application and clients. xmcp supports HTTP transport for web-based applications and APIs, and STDIO transport for local command-line tools and desktop apps.

**Middleware** provides a way to add authentication and authorization, log requests and responses, transform data, handle errors, and implement rate limiting and caching.

## Getting Started

The following articles will guide you through building your first MCP application, from installation and project setup to writing tools and configuring your application for production deployment.
