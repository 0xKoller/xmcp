# Getting Started

Welcome to the xmcp documentation!

This section will help you get started building your first xmcp app. You will learn about all the available features you can use to build MCP servers, seamlessly.

The framework is designed to be simple and easy to use, but it requires some knowledge of TypeScript and Model Context Protocol. We assume you already cover the basics of programming and are familiar with functional programming.

If you're new to Model Context Protocol, you can learn more about it [here](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction).

Along the guide, we'll provide insights and examples which will help you grasp the core concepts.

Next up, we'll walk you through the [installation](./installation) process.
