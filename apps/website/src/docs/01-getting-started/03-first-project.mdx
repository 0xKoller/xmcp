# Creating Your First Project

This guide walks through creating your first xmcp project, understanding the generated files, and running your first MCP application.

## Project Creation

Create a new project using the xmcp CLI. The command will prompt you for configuration options including package manager selection, transport types (HTTP for web services, STDIO for local execution), and optional Vercel deployment support:

```bash
npm create xmcp-app@latest my-weather-app
```

For automated setup without prompts, you can use the `--yes` flag along with options like `--use-pnpm` and `--vercel` to skip the interactive configuration.

## Understanding the Generated Files

After creation, your project contains several key files. The `package.json` defines your dependencies and scripts, with `xmcp dev` for development, `xmcp build` for production builds, and `xmcp build --vercel` for Vercel deployment. The `src/tools/add.ts` file demonstrates a complete tool implementation with schema validation, metadata, and a handler function.

The example tool shows the three required exports: a `schema` object using Zod for parameter validation, a `metadata` object with tool information and annotations, and a default function that implements the tool logic. The schema defines parameter types and descriptions, while metadata provides the tool name, description, and behavioral hints like whether the tool is read-only or idempotent.

## Running Your Project

Start the development server with `npm run dev`. You'll see output indicating which tools were discovered and that the server is running on HTTP and STDIO transports. The development server includes hot reloading, so any changes to your tool files will automatically restart the server.

Test your tool by making a POST request to the HTTP endpoint. The request uses JSON-RPC 2.0 format with a method of `tools/call` and parameters including the tool name and arguments. The response follows MCP format with content array containing the result.

## Configuration Options

You can customize your application using either `xmcp.config.json` for simple configuration or `xmcp.config.ts` for more advanced scenarios. The configuration allows you to set HTTP port, CORS settings, enable or disable transports, and customize webpack builds. Environment variables can be accessed through `process.env` and should be defined in a `.env` file.

## Building for Production

Use `npm run build` to create a production build in the `dist/` directory with compiled JavaScript, type definitions, and source maps. For Vercel deployment, `npm run build --vercel` creates the appropriate serverless function structure in `.vercel/output/`.

_Great job! Continue to [Project Structure](./project-structure) to understand how xmcp projects are organized._
