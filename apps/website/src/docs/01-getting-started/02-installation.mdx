# Installation

## Prerequisites

Before installing xmcp, ensure you have Node.js version 18 or higher installed on your system. You can check your Node.js version by running `node --version` in your terminal. You'll also need one of the following package managers: npm (comes with Node.js), yarn, or pnpm.

## Creating a New Project

The fastest way to get started is using the `create-xmcp-app` command, which will scaffold a new project with all the necessary files and configuration:

```bash
npm create xmcp-app@latest my-mcp-app
```

The command will prompt you to configure your project. You can choose your preferred package manager, select which transports you want to use (HTTP for web services, STDIO for local execution), and optionally add Vercel deployment support. For automated setup without prompts, use the `--yes` flag with additional options like `--use-pnpm` or `--vercel`.

## Project Structure

After installation, your project will have a `src/tools/` directory where your MCP tools are automatically discovered, a `package.json` with the necessary dependencies and scripts, TypeScript configuration files, and optional xmcp configuration files for customizing your application.

## Verification

Navigate to your project directory and run `npm run dev` to start the development server. You should see output indicating that the server is running on HTTP (typically port 3002) and that tools have been discovered. The default project includes an example "add" tool that you can test by making a POST request to the `/mcp` endpoint.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in your project root for any environment-specific configuration like API keys, database URLs, or authentication secrets. These variables will be automatically loaded when your application starts.

## Next Steps

Your xmcp project is now set up and ready for development. The development server includes hot reloading, so changes to your code will automatically restart the server. You can begin by exploring the generated example tool and then create your own tools in the `src/tools/` directory.
